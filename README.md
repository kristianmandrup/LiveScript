# LiveScript
is a language which compiles to JavaScript. It has a straightforward mapping to JavaScript and allows you to write expressive code devoid of repetitive boilerplate. While LiveScript adds many features to assist in functional style programming, it also has many improvements for object oriented and imperative programming.

## ES6 and harmony

This branch merges the *generators* branch with master.
`package.json` exposes `test-harmony` which runs tests in `node --harmony` mode.
The *generators* branch contains a generators test which will pass when run on a `node` version which support generators.

This branch aims to further support ES6 syntax by leveraging the traceur transpiler, which compiles ES6 code to ES5 compatible code so it
can be run in ES5 javascript environments.
